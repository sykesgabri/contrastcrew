					<b>Eye protection is incredibly important and should absolutely not be glossed over.</b> The consequences of not using proper eye protection can be your eyesight, and that is something you absolutely must keep in mind, you should always wear proper eye protection at <b>every</b> nerf event you attend, and if you host any nerf events you should make proper eye protection a mandatory rule. <b>Sunglasses do not count as proper eye protection.</b> Pictured alongside this text is an example of regular non-eyepro sunglasses that were hit by a half dart FVJ out of a modified blaster. (Thank you to kerb23 or u/caschrock for providing permission to use this image.) As you can see, the sunglasses did not do anything to stop the dart, and as a result, if anyone was wearing said sunglasses, they very likely would've lost an eye.

				<p class="right_paragraph">
					So if sunglasses aren't good, what are? Well, a good choice would be a pair of <b>impact rated</b> safety glasses. When shopping for safety glasses you should pay attention to the legislation, which is usually listed under the eyepro's specs, the two most common types of legislation are "EN" and "ANSI", it doesn't matter which you get as long as you understand how each legislation works, and choose eyepro that can withstand the impacts it would be seeing at an actual nerf event. [Insert recommended impact ratings for nerf eyepro and sources to back those claims up.] If you require prescription lenses in order to see, please talk to your optician about prescription impact rated eye protection, mention the impact ratings you'll need and ask what is available. A cheaper alternative would be getting a pair of safety goggles that are designed to be worn over-top of a normal pair of glasses, they look like the image provided alongside this text.<br>
					<br>
					Kerb23 tested a pair of amazon basics safety glasses and a paintball mask using an afpro dart at 400FPS, and they both held up. However, we don't know the specs of these items. The amazon glasses had no specs listed on the page, and the paintball mask was picked up at a garage sale years ago. The moral of this story is that if you have something but are unaware of its specs, <b>we encourage you to do your own destructive testing</b>, modify a blaster to fire a bit above the FPS cap of the events you plan to attend, load in an fvj (this is the only situation where we endorse the use of fvjs) to create a worst case scenario, fix the item in place so it won't move when hit, and fire at it. If it holds up, it should be safe for an event, if it breaks, be thankful you won't be wearing it at an event.
